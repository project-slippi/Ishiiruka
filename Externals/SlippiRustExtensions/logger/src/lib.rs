//! This library provides a tracing subscriber configuration that works with the
//! Dolphin logging setup.
//!
//! It essentially maps the concept of a `LogContainer` over to Rust, and provides
//! hooks to forward state change calls in. On top of that, this module contains
//! a custom `tracing_subscriber::Layer` that will pass logs back to Dolphin.
//!
//! Ultimately this should mean no log fragmentation or confusion.
