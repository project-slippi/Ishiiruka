# Slippi Jukebox

Slippi Jukebox is a built-in solution to play Melee's OST in a manner that's effectively detached from emulation.

1. _Alternate stage music has a 12.5% chance of playing. Holding triggers to force alternate tracks to play is not supported._

2. _In some 1P modes, stage music will differ from vs mode. This behavior is not supported by jukebox. Additionally, the following songs will not play:_
	<ul>
		<li>Classic "Stage Clear" Jingle</li>
		<li>Classic "Continue?" and "Game Over" Jingles</li>
		<li>Credits music</li>
		<li>Post-credits congratulations fmv music</li>
	</ul>

## How it works

When a `Jukebox` instance is created (generally from an EXI Device), it scans the iso for music files and stores their locations + file sizes in a hashmap.

Two child threads are immediately spawned: `JukeboxMessageDispatcher` and `JukeboxMusicPlayer`. Together these threads form an event loop.

The message dispatcher continuously reads from dolphin's game memory and dispatches relevant events. The music player thread listens to the events and handles them by decoding the appropriate music files and playing them with the default audio device.

When the `Jukebox` instance is dropped, the child threads are instructed to terminate, the event loop breaks, and the music stops.
